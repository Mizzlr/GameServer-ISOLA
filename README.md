A Battle field for the Bot for ISOLA

Isola is a two-player abstract strategy board game. It is played on a 7x7 board
which is initially filled with squares, except at the starting positions of the
pieces. Both players have one piece; it is in the middle position of the row
closest to his/her side of the board.

A move consists of two subsequent actions:

1. Moving one's piece to a neighboring (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
    position that contains a square but not the opponent's piece
2. Removing any square with no piece on it, similar to the arrow effect in Game
    of the Amazons.

The player who cannot make any move loses the game.
